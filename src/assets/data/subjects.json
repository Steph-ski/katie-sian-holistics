    "description": "I love working with children, helping them understand how their brains work and equipping them with strategies to navigate life's ups and downs. I truly believe that all young people would benefit from this knowledge, and my dream is to bring my programme into local schools so that every child has access to these essential life skills.\n\nI work 1:1 with primary aged children, tailoring each session to their interests and needs. Sessions are structured, practical and fun, designed to help children build confidence, resilience and a deeper understanding of themselves. These skills support them not just now, but for the rest of their lives.\n\nI offer an initial block of six sessions, with the option to extend if needed. To start, I provide a free phone consultation for parents to discuss how I can support your child. This is followed by a free face to face consultation with you and your child.",
